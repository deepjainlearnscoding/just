                        Starting, how late you were haha, well not even your fault.<br>
                        We were supposed to meet around 2pm but got a bit late haha, then having that handshake then
                        searching for an exit, not knowing where to go.<br>
                        Then you came to rescue, somehow got the exit, and i got stuck as my ticket wasn't working.<br>
                        A crazy experience indeed.<br><br>
                        Then roaming together in Delhi HAAT INA and forcing you to eat something<br>
                        Hahaha, it was fun honestly, should've had guts back in 10th and talked to you atleast once.<br>
                        This was totally on me lmao.<br><br>
                        Then handing you the bouquet 😂🤭💗 don't even have to mention that, this will forever be with
                        me<br>
                        At that time, didn't knew we would end up this way honestly.<br>
                        I thought i was just a "Bhaiya" to you lmao.<br>
                        But you had feelings back then asw, which kind of shocked me<br><br>
                        Just always stay the way you are, never ever change.<br>
                        Change in terms of how u express yourself, you seem to be a quiet little kid<br>
                        But inside you is something else, which i love the most.<br>
                        Try to be more expressive my queen!<br>
                        Everyone would love to see the inside version of yours.<br>
                        Forever yours, ❤️❤️ (❁´◡`❁)

                        We still haven't spend much time together, and i would like to go everywhere with you.<br>
                        The one day we met, it was so fun, i really want to meet you every single day if it was possible
                        ever.<br>
                        Can't say if that was the best day with you. But honestly everyday i talk to you, it
                        automatically becomes a best day.<br>
                        Can't wait for the day, when we meet again.<br>
